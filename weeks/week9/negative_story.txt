In a dilapidated house at the outskirts of an abandoned town, an old man named Walter lived alone. His days were as silent as the unvisited streets outside, save for the creaks and groans of the settling house. The town had once been vibrant, a tapestry of community and shared lives, but it had withered away as the nearby factory, once the heart of the town's economy, shut down. One by one, the residents departed, leaving behind empty homes like hollow memories.Walter remained. His wife, Clara, had passed away years before the town's decline. She had been the melody of his life, and without her, time seemed to lose its cadence. He couldn't bring himself to leave the place where every corner still whispered her name, where the dust was imbued with the laughter they had shared. His children, grown and busy with lives that no longer needed old stories or an old man, urged him to move away, but the thought of leaving felt like abandoning Clara all over again.Winter came unkindly, its cold seeping through the gaps in the walls, the blankets too thin to fight it off. Walter's joints ached with the chill, his breath visible in the air of his own home. Food was scarce, his appetite even scarcer, driven away by loneliness more biting than hunger.At night, he'd light a candle, the flame flickering like the failing pulse of the town, and talk to Clara's photograph, recounting days that seemed to belong to another life. He spoke of his regrets, his longing, and the sorrow of outliving the world he cherished. Each word was a weight, a stone tied to his soul, pulling him deeper into despair.The candle would burn out, but the darkness mattered little. It was in the inky shadows that he felt Clara closest, her absence an oppressive presence, the silence a constant reminder that, despite the vastness of the empty town, it was in his heart where the void was most profound. The world outside had succumbed to the ghost of its past, and inside, Walter, too, was a ghost, living in the echoes of what was, with only the certainty of solitude to accompany him to the end.
