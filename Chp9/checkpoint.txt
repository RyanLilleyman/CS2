1. Object serialization is when you take a file and convert it into a stream of bytes for later processing.

2. outputFile = open('mydata.dat', 'wb')
which is writing in binary mode.

3. inputFile = open('mydata.dat','rb')
which is read binary mode

4. you import the pickle module to pickel objects

5. you use pickle.dump(object, filename)

6. you use pickle.load(inputFile)



You can use the in operator to determine whether a key exists inside of a dictionary.
You can use the del dictionaryName[key] to delete an element out of a dictionary.

you can add  one elementto a set with the add method
you can add a group of elements to a set with the update method
the set method that removes an element but does not raise an exception if the element is not found is the discard method, the remove method returns a keyerror

the or operator can be used to find the union of two sets
the difference operator for difference of A - B 
the & for the intersection of two sets
the ^ for the symmetric difference between two sets.
